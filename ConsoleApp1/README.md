# ConsoleApp1

## Description
This is a console app that provides nine different simple games while demonstrating basic code using C# programming language.

## Games
- IfConditionals: You will be made to enter two numbers and then guess the product of the numbers. It demonstrates the use of "if" conditionals.
- UsingSwitches: You will be made to enter the day of the week and have the short version of the name of the day printed in the console. It demonstrates the use of "switch and case".
- ForLoops: With this game, you provide a message and the number of times you want the message to be repeatedly printed on the console. It demonstrates the use of "for" loops.
- UsingWhile: You will be made to enter two numbers and then guess the product of the numbers until you have it right. It demonstrates the use of "while" loops.
- UsingDoWhile: You will be made to enter two numbers and then guess the product of the numbers until you have it right. It demonstrates the use of "do while" loops.
- FizzBuzz: This will check numbers from 1 to the number provided against 3 and 5. If the number is divisible by both 3 and 5, FizzBuzz will be printed. Fizz will be printed if number is divisible by 3 and Buzz when divisible by 5. It demonstrates the use of "for" loop and "if" conditionals.
- FillAndFind: This lets you decide which numbers you want to store in a box. Then you get find the position of a number you choose from the given set when the numbers are arranged in descending order. It demonstrates the use of arrays.
- OddAndEven: This lets you provide minumun and maximum numbers and the program generates the odd and even numbers within the numbers (with the numbers inclusive). It demonstrates the use of Lists.
- ListFriends: This program let's you to add, remove, update a friends info or list friends. It demonstrates the use of Classes, instance methods, getters and setters, etc.
